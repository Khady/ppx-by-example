## PPX by examples

:warning: **This repository is a work in progress.** :warning:

This repository contains examples to help on understanding what are and how to write PPXs in OCaml and for it we are going to use PPXLib.

On my ppx learning journey, I had some difficulties to find examples and explanations about how to write a PPX. So, I decided to create this repository to help others that are in the same situation as me, here, you can run the examples, see the results and read about each one on its README.
